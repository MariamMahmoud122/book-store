            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p> Reading is extremely good for you.
                 It focuses the mind, hones concentration and improves memory, 
                all in scientifically proven ways.* It is also a way to open your mind to other cultures, 
                other perspectives, other ways of life. Reading on screen, listening or watching television and/or films does not bring the same mental benefits as the slow, 
                in depth, contemplative exercise of reading on the page. It also teaches problem solving and lowers stress. If you think it is important to do a sport or take exercise for the body, 
                itâ€™s equally essential to work out the brain
                , or else we risk becoming insular, forgetful, restless and opinionated</p>
